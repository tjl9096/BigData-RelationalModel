# BigData-RelationalModel

As an assignment for my Intro to Big Data class, we were asked to do a few tasks. The main point of the assignment was to get us used to working with postgresql in a coding setting, but we were also asked to make a few models of the data as well. 

All written portions of the assignment can be found in the report pdf while the coding portions can be found both as the App.zip file and as raw files in the repository.

I am unsure if I am allowed to post the questions, but I am assuming I am not. So, you can speculate what the questions may have been from my work. Additionally, I am not sure if I can give the dataset as well, but I can say that the data came from the askUbuntu web service.

Note: I am aware that this solution is very ugly and highly inneficient. This was first time working with xml files and I had trouble getting them to work right due to the size. If you look at the BigData-SQL repository, you will see a lot of improvements to my work.
